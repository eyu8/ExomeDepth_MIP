Plotting the gene data
Sample number: MIP.S35281.clean.bam
Optimization of the choice of aggregate reference set, this process can take some time
Number of selected bins: 1691
Now creating the ExomeDepth object
Now fitting the beta-binomial model on a data frame with 1880 rows : this step can take a few minutes.
Now computing the likelihood for the different copy number states
Reference for this samples:2
Correlation between reference and tests count is 0.97999
To get meaningful result, this correlation should really be above 0.97. If this is not the case, consider the output of ExomeDepth as less reliable (i.e. most likely a high false positive rate)
